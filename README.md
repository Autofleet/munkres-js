Munkres implementation for Javascript
---------------------------------

## Introduction

The Munkres module provides an implementation of the Munkres algorithm
(also called the [Hungarian algorithm][] or the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm).
The algorithm models an assignment problem as an NÃ—M cost matrix, where
each element represents the cost of assigning the ith worker to the jth
job, and it figures out the least-cost solution, choosing a single item
from each row and column in the matrix, such that no row and no column are
used more than once.

[Hungarian algorithm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm

See the docs in munkres.js for more details.

## Meta

This module is a translation of a Python implementation by
